# Summary

Hypertension is a common disorder that affects a large proportion of the community. It is usually asymptomatic and is detected on routine examination or after the occurrence of a complication such as a heart attack or stroke.1

Hypertension has been defined in joint guidelines by American learned bodies (American College of Cardiology [ACC] and American Heart Association [AHA] among others)2 and also by the British Society of Hypertension3 and the European Society of Hypertension4. There are differences in the definition of hypertension between guidelines.

The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults defines hypertension as any systolic blood pressure measurement of ≥130 mmHg or any diastolic blood pressure measurement of ≥80 mmHg.2 ACC/AHA blood pressure categories are defined as follows:

- Elevated blood pressure: systolic blood pressure of 120-129 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of <80 mmHg
- Stage 1 hypertension: systolic blood pressure of 130-139 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of 80-89 mmHg
- Stage 2 hypertension: systolic blood pressure of ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of ≥90 mmHg.

The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines definition represents a more aggressive approach to diagnosis and treatment of hypertension compared with Joint National Committee (JNC) 7 and JNC 8 recommendations, where blood pressure in the range of 120-139 mmHg/80-89 mmHg is considered pre-hypertension and blood pressure >140/90 mmHg is considered elevated.5 6

Publication of the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines has prompted widespread debate, and there are calls for the recommendations to be revisited. Implementing the guidelines would increase the prevalence of hypertension by 26.8% in the US. Critics are concerned that labelling more patients as hypertensive could increase psychological morbidity, as well as exposing lower-risk patients to the potential harm of antihypertensive medications.7

The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines were mainly based on the results of the SPRINT trial, which investigated intensive or standard hypertension treatment in people with a systolic blood pressure of ≥130 mmHg with an increased cardiovascular risk (but without diabetes). Listen to our podcast for more on the controversy. [BMJ Best Practice Podcast: hypertension]

European guidelines categorise hypertension as follows:4

- High-normal: systolic 130-139 mmHg and/or diastolic 85-89 mmHg
- Grade 1: systolic 140-159 mmHg and/or diastolic 90-99 mmHg
- Grade 2: systolic 160-179 mmHg and/or diastolic 100-109 mmHg
- Grade 3: systolic ≥180 mmHg and/or diastolic ≥110 mmHg.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines use a definition of hypertension similar to the European guideline.9

Isolated systolic hypertension is also graded according to systolic blood pressure values in the ranges indicated, provided that diastolic values are <90 mmHg.4
---
Although different studies have used a variety of cut-off points for the diagnosis of hypertension in the community, any blood pressure &gt;120 mmHg systolic is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. The importance of hypertension is its relation to other cardiovascular risk factors and consequent overall cardiovascular risk. The AHA defines resistant hypertension as:

- Clinic blood pressure &gt;130/80 mmHg despite the concurrent use of at least 3 antihypertensive agents (including an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor antagonist, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, and a diuretic) at maximum or maximally tolerated doses.
- Patients who require 4 or more antihypertensive agents to achieve their target blood pressure are also considered to have resistant hypertension. The diagnosis requires the exclusion of white-coat hypertension and poor adherence with antihypertensive medication.

This topic addresses the assessment of hypertension in adults.

# Epidemiology:

Based on National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) data from 2013 to 2016, an estimated 116.4 million US adults aged ≥20 years have hypertension (cut-off value 140/90 mmHg). During this period, the prevalence of hypertension was 26.1% among those aged 20-44 years, 59.2% among those aged 45-64 years, and 78.2% among those aged ≥65 years. The prevalence may be similar or higher in Western Europe. Globally, the overall prevalence of hypertension in adults is 30% to 45%, according to European guidelines, with a higher prevalence in men than in women (24% and 20%, respectively). Hypertension is more prevalent in black people than in white people, starting in childhood, with 76% of black men and women developing hypertension by age 55 years, compared with 55% and 40% of white men and women, respectively. The exact prevalence of hypertension is difficult to assess, as it is usually asymptomatic. Prevalence is expected to rise as the 'cut-off' value for hypertension is re-defined at a lower level. Approximately 15% of patients with hypertension have resistant hypertension.

# Complications and target organ damage:

Studies have shown that treatment of hypertension can reduce the incidence of future cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. The aim of early diagnosis and treatment of hypertension is to lower overall cardiovascular risk and prevent cerebrovascular events. The effects of chronic hypertension on organ systems are referred to as target organ damage. Left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertensive retinopathy, and nephropathy are the most common manifestations. The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy is a poor prognostic sign, and regression of left ventricular hypertrophy improves prognosis. Patients with resistant hypertension are at higher risk of experiencing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and developing chronic kidney disease.

# Cardiovascular risk:

Guidelines on the management of hypertension emphasise the importance of calculating and managing the overall cardiovascular risk of a patient, rather than focusing only on blood pressure

readings. The ACC and AHA have published an online tool to calculate patients’ 10-year and lifetime risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. [ACC: ASCVD Risk Estimator Plus] For individuals aged 40-70 years, each increment of 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure or 10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure across the entire blood pressure range from 115/75 to 185/115 mmHg doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease.[18] Treating associated cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, and smoking are as important as managing hypertension in lowering overall cardiovascular risk.

Meta-analysis has confirmed that lowering blood pressure reduces cardiovascular disease and death in people with baseline systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or higher.[19] However, primary preventive blood pressure lowering does not benefit people with lower baseline blood pressure (except those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease).[19] One Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to justify lower blood pressure targets (≤135/85 mmHg) in people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease.[20]

# OVERVIEW Assessment of hypertension

# Overview

# Aetiology

Primary hypertension

This is the most common situation, when no underlying cause can be found to account for elevated blood pressure. It is also referred to as essential hypertension. A genetic basis has been suggested. Lifestyle influences such as obesity, sedentary lifestyle, excess alcohol intake, and high sodium intake are all thought to promote the development of essential hypertension.

Secondary hypertension

In a minority of cases, an underlying, often reversible cause can be found. This may be suspected in a younger patient (<40 years of age), when blood pressure is resistant to first-line medication, or if a patient with previously well-controlled hypertension suddenly becomes difficult to manage while remaining compliant with their medication.

Vascular

One of pe most common secondary causes of hypertension is renal artery stenosis. This may be entirely asymptomatic but, if hypertension is difficult to control and pe patient is young, renal artery stenosis should be excluded. Stenosis is usually due to fibromuscular dysplasia or aperosclerosis, but oper causes include extrinsic compression of pe artery by an adjacent tumour or a proximal aneurysm of pe renal artery.
Coarctation of pe aorta is a congenital narrowing of pe aorta. When presenting in adults wip hypertension, pis narrowing is usually distal to pe ligamentum arteriosum, alpough coarctation can occur before or at pe site of pe ligamentous insertion. There is usually hypertension in pe upper limbs but weak or absent pulses in pe lower limbs. This combination of signs will raise suspicion of a coarctation on clinical examination.
Pre-eclampsia is a syndrome of hypertension wip proteinuria in pregnant women. Its exact cause is unknown, but pe placenta is pought to release factors, perhaps in response to hypoxia, pat affect pe vascular endopelium in susceptible women. It can also occur up to 2 monps after birp. Women wip pre-existing hypertension, diabetes, or autoimmune disease are pought to be at greater risk of developing pre-eclampsia.
Chronic kidney disease: a decrease in pe glomerular filtration rate will stimulate pe kidneys to up-regulate production of renin to raise pe blood pressure and renal perfusion. Fluid overload will also contribute as pe kidneys fail to excrete volumes required for homeostasis. Bop of pese mechanisms can lead to hypertension.
Nephrotic syndrome: a syndrome of proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema caused by damage to pe filtering capability of pe renal glomeruli. Hypertension in pis setting is not common but can occur due to salt and water retention and fluid overload. ACE inhibitors are pe first-choice agent for blood pressure control in nephrotic syndrome, as pey may also reduce proteinuria.
Glomerulonephritis: a condition characterized by inflammation of pe glomeruli. Hypertension is a main feature of pis syndrome, via mechanisms similar to pose in chronic renal failure.
Obstructive uropapy: pis can produce hydronephrosis, and pe back-pressure on pe kidneys can result in renal failure and elevated blood pressure prough similar mechanisms.

# Assessment of hypertension

Polycystic kidneys
hypertension is a common presenting symptom, and it is often apparent before renal function abnormalities. Hypertension with polycystic kidney disease can present at a young age (20 to 34 years) and is associated with a high incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy.

# Endocrine

|Phaeochromocytoma|this is a neuroendocrine tumour of the adrenal glands. Hypertension results from excessive secretion of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). It can also occur as part of a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome. Patients may present with malignant hypertension or hypertension that is resistant to usual pharmacological therapy.|
|---|---|
|Hyperaldosteronism|excess production of aldosterone by the adrenal glands results in sodium and water retention and potassium excretion. The excess production of aldosterone is usually due to a solitary adrenal adenoma (Conn's syndrome), but hyperaldosteronism and consequent hypertension can also be the result of adrenal hyperplasia. Despite the fact that primary hyperaldosteronism is the most common cause for secondary hypertension, it is a diagnosis that is frequently missed.|
|Cushing's syndrome|excess production of cortisol by a pituitary or adrenal tumour, or the use of exogenous corticosteroids, can result in Cushing's syndrome. It can be adrenocorticotropic hormone-dependent or -independent. Hypertension results as cortisol enhances the vasoconstrictor effect of catecholamines.|
|Hyperthyroidism|excess thyroxine exacerbates the effect of the sympathetic nervous system. It thereby increases vascular resistance and cardiac output. This can lead to an isolated systolic hypertension. Hypertension should respond to treatment of the underlying cause.|
|Hypothyroidism|low levels of circulating thyroid hormone can also result in mild hypertension as the heart rate is slowed and there is an increase in peripheral vascular resistance to compensate. Hypothyroidism can also cause elevation of cholesterol and lipid levels in the blood, thus increasing overall cardiovascular risk if left untreated.|
|Hyperparathyroidism|hypertension is often noted in patients with hyperparathyroidism, but a causative relationship has not been confirmed and the mechanism is unclear.|

# Sleep disorders

Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea
are often obese, with an increased risk for hypertension. They also have an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. The mechanism is unclear but may involve oxidative stress secondary to hypoxia and sympathetic autonomic activation. Such patients often have a number of cardiovascular risk factors that need addressing alongside treatment of their hypertension and sleep apnoea.

# Toxic causes

|Chronic alcohol excess|the relationship between alcohol, hypertension, and overall cardiovascular risk is complex and a J-shaped relationship has been suggested, with those who drink a small amount of alcohol having a lower risk than those who abstain completely. However, in various studies, alcoholic people who abstain from alcohol have demonstrated a marked decrease in blood pressure readings after an initial increase during the withdrawal phase. The mechanisms are unclear.|
|---|---|
|Illicit drug use such as cocaine and metamfetamine abuse|can lead to hypertension due to sympathetic activation. The potential for reduced compliance with antihypertensive therapy in this patient population may result in persistent high blood pressure.|

# OVERVIEW

Assessment of hypertension

Overview

- Use of oral contraceptives and long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have bop been implicated in pe development of hypertension: pe former due to pe effects of progesterone on small blood vessels; NSAIDs prough effects on pe kidney and fluid retention in susceptible individuals. Hypertension will usually respond to discontinuation of pe drugs.
- Hypertension is a common adverse effect of glucocorticoids, ciclosporin, and atypical antipsychotics.
- Up to 80% of patients treated wip vascular endopelial growp factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors for metastatic solid organ malignancy develop hypertension.

# Pseudo-hypertension

- 'White-coat hypertension' is an apparent elevation of blood pressure when readings are taken in a clinical environment. The patient may have their own blood pressure monitor at home and report normal readings. This apparent elevation is usually ascribed to anxiety or stress at having their blood pressure measured. It may subside with repeat measurements over time, or persist in the clinical environment. One way to distinguish true hypertension from falsely elevated readings is to record blood pressure over a 24-hour period or arrange measurements at home. This will avoid unnecessary treatment, although overall cardiovascular risk must still be evaluated.

# Resistant hypertension

Resistant hypertension (RH) is defined as above-goal elevated blood pressure despite the concurrent use of three antihypertensive drug classes, commonly including a long-acting calcium channel blocker, a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker), and a diuretic.

Consider causes of secondary hypertension in patients with RH.

Consider non-adherence and white-coat hypertension as causes of apparent treatment-resistant hypertension. Estimates of non-adherence to hypertension medication range from 7% to 60%. The American Heart Association recommends using the following question to assess adherence: 'When taking multiple medications, it is common to miss doses throughout the week. How many times do you miss taking your blood pressure medication in a week?' White-coat hypertension can be excluded by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or home blood pressure measurements.

Poor blood pressure measurement technique can give falsely elevated blood pressure readings.

# Assessment of Hypertension Emergencies

Urgent considerations

(See Differential diagnosis for more details)

Severe elevations in blood pressure are classified as either emergencies or urgencies.[30] In hypertensive emergencies there is severe hypertension (>180/120 mmHg) with evidence of new or worsening end organ damage.[2] This is an immediate threat to the cardiovascular system and the patient. In hypertensive urgencies, there is severe hypertension but the patient is otherwise stable with no evidence of acute or impending change in end organ damage or dysfunction.[2]

True hypertensive emergencies include hypertensive encephalopathy, hypertensive left ventricular failure, and acute aortic dissection. The management of these conditions includes immediate treatment in an intensive care setting with controlled gradual reduction in blood pressure. Initial laboratory tests should include a full blood profile and urine analysis to search for an underlying cause. Tests such as cardiac enzymes, thyroid function tests, urinary catecholamines, and vanillylmandelic acid may also be required. Elevations in urea and creatinine, raised sodium and phosphate levels, high or low potassium levels (particularly in hyperaldosteronism, as a result of renal potassium wasting), and acidosis are some of the common findings.

Imaging studies such as a chest x-ray and renal ultrasound scan can also help to rule out underlying aetiology. Computerised tomography of the head to assess for intracranial haemorrhage or infarction or space-occupying lesions may also be indicated. A 12-lead ECG is useful to assess for cardiac ischaemia or infarct, presence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and evidence of electrolyte disturbance or effects of drug overdose. If left untreated, these conditions are associated with a high mortality and morbidity. Fortunately, with the widespread use of antihypertensive agents, they are less commonly seen overall.[30] [31] [32]

# Specific Hypertensive Emergencies

# Hypertensive Encephalopathy

- This is a symptom complex of severe hypertension with headache, vomiting, visual disturbance, mental status changes, seizure, and papilloedema. Cardiac symptoms such as angina, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary oedema may occasionally be the main presenting symptoms.

# Hypertensive Left Ventricular Failure

- Symptoms are those of decompensated cardiac failure with shortness of breath, pulmonary oedema, lethargy, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, and orthopnoea. A cough productive of frothy pink sputum may be reported. Left heart failure can lead to bi-ventricular failure, and there may be signs of peripheral oedema and hepatomegaly. An echocardiogram will usually be indicated, and imaging of the coronary arteries may be helpful as reversible cardiac ischaemia may improve symptoms and prognosis.

# Acute Aortic Dissection

- Typically presents with acute, severe chest pain with 'ripping' or 'tearing' characteristics. It may radiate to the back or jaw. Syncope, altered cognition, and anxiety are common neurological symptoms. A blood pressure difference of >20 mmHg is suggestive but not diagnostic of an acute aortic dissection. Treatment will depend on the portion of the aorta that is affected and may include surgical repair, endovascular stenting, or medical therapy alone. All patients require close monitoring and intensive care.

# EMERGENCIES Assessment of hypertension Emergencies

treatment of blood pressure and pulse, usually in a high-dependency or intensive care unit wip appropriate specialist input.

# Hypertensive urgencies

# Malignant or accelerated hypertension

Malignant hypertension is associated wip potentially irreversible target organ damage pat occurs over days or weeks, raper pan minutes, and is perefore classified as an urgency. It is characterised by very high blood pressure in association wip bilateral retinal changes, including exudates and haemorrhages, wip or wipout papilloedema. The most common symptoms include headaches (often occipital), visual disturbances, chest pain, dyspnoea, and neurological deficits. Consequences include cerebral infarction or haemorrhage, transient blindness or paralyses, seizures, stupor, or coma. Malignant hypertension often has a renal cause, and proteinuria, microscopic haematuria, red blood cell, and hyaline casts in urine are typical.

# Asymptomatic high blood pressure

This is a common occurrence, where an asymptomatic patient (eiper known to have hypertension on treatment or previously not known to have hypertension), is found to have very high readings in pe 'accelerated hypertension' range. If pere are any signs of retinal involvement, pey should be managed as per 'malignant hypertension' or 'accelerated hypertension' guidelines. However, if pere is no target organ involvement, pey should be evaluated for pe cause of pe high blood pressure.
If a patient is already on antihypertensive medications, care should be taken to check compliance or worsening renal function. If pe increase in blood pressure has occurred over time, it could simply reflect pe need to up-titrate drug dosage, as pe current dosage may not be sufficient. A history of illicit drug use should also be sought, as pis can cause a sudden increase in blood pressure. Screening for a secondary cause is also important.
If pe patient is drug-naive, pen pey should be managed as per any individual wip newly diagnosed hypertension, wip screening for secondary causes, end organ damage, and cardiovascular risk.

# Pre-eclampsia

Pre-eclampsia is new-onset persistent hypertension, wip eiper proteinuria or evidence of systemic involvement, pat occurs in pregnant women after 20 weeks' gestation. Women wip pre-eclampsia require specialist obstetric care. The details of diagnosis and management are beyond pe scope of pis topic. For furper information, please see pe Best Practice topic on Pre-eclampsia.

# Assessment of hypertension

# Diagnosis

Step-by-step diagnostic approach

Hypertension is usually asymptomatic, but patients may present with headaches, nosebleeds, visual symptoms, or neurological symptoms. The main aims of history-taking are to identify symptoms suggestive of a secondary cause, to establish concomitant risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and to seek any symptoms suggestive of target organ damage. Often there are no physical signs. However, a full examination for any signs of an underlying condition or target organ damage is recommended. This should include height, weight, waist circumference, palpation and auscultation of the heart and carotid arteries, palpation of peripheral pulses, neurological examination, and fundoscopy. An absence of symptoms or end organ damage with a history of normal blood pressure readings outside the clinical environment may occur with pseudo-hypertension.

Baseline screening tests are useful in all patients to look for complications of hypertension. Specific tests are only recommended if the clinical suspicion of an underlying secondary cause is high, as the majority of patients will have essential (primary) hypertension.

# Blood pressure measurement

Before a diagnosis of hypertension can be confirmed, it is essential that the blood pressure is checked correctly. The patient should sit quietly for at least 5 minutes with the arm exposed and supported at the level of the heart, and the back resting against a chair. Ideally they should not have consumed caffeine or smoked tobacco within 30 minutes before testing. Canadian guidelines recommend electronic (oscillometric) upper arm devices instead of using auscultation to measure blood pressure in the clinic setting. If an automatic machine is used, it needs to be correctly calibrated, and calibration should be checked at least every 6 months. The width of the cuff should be equal to 80% of the arm circumference and cover two-thirds of the length of the arm (a small bladder can cause falsely elevated readings). The cuff should be positioned at the level of the heart. The patient’s back and arm should be supported because muscle contractions can elevate blood pressure readings. The bell of the stethoscope should be used. The cuff should be inflated to at least 20 mmHg above the pressure at which the radial pulse disappears, and should be deflated at a rate of approximately 3 mmHg/second in order to accurately identify the point at which Korotkoff sounds can first be heard. Diastolic blood pressure in adults is measured as the point at which Korotkoff sounds disappear (Phase V). Blood pressure should be checked in both arms and the arm with the higher reading should be used. A consistent difference of >15 mmHg in systolic blood pressure between arms is associated with peripheral vascular disease and increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Two readings should be taken 1-2 minutes apart. Elevated readings should be confirmed by 3 sets of readings at weekly intervals.

The patient’s pulse should be palpated to exclude arrhythmia. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends that patients with atrial fibrillation should have manual auscultatory blood pressure measurements (as few automated devices have been calibrated for use in this population). The ESC also recommends measuring blood pressure 1 minute and 3 minutes after standing from a seated position to exclude orthostatic hypotension.

Automated office blood pressure (AOBP) is intended to more accurately measure blood pressure. Multiple measurements are taken while the patient is alone in a quiet room, sitting with legs uncrossed, back supported, and arm supported at heart level. Depending on the device used, 3-6 measurements are taken over a short time period and the mean blood pressure is calculated. When using AOBP, hypertension is defined as ≥135/85 mmHg.

# DIAGNOSIS Assessment of hypertension Diagnosis

Before therapy is initiated, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) or regular home monitoring is recommended to document true hypertension outside the clinic setting. One meta-analysis comparing clinic- and home-based blood pressure measurements with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in adults found that neither clinic- nor home-based measurements had sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as a single diagnostic test, and that doing so may lead to substantial over-diagnosis. ABPM has many advantages in that it helps to diagnose 'white-coat hypertension' and masked hypertension, recognizes episodes of symptomatic hypotension, and identifies dipping patterns and early morning surges in blood pressure. Masked hypertension is defined as a normal blood pressure in the clinic or office (<130/90 mmHg), but an elevated blood pressure out of the clinic (ambulatory daytime blood pressure or home blood pressure >135/85 mmHg). There is no universal agreement on definitions of hypertension measured by out-of-office blood pressure monitoring, but European guidelines suggest a cut-off of 135/85 mmHg for daytime ABPM or home blood pressure. The US American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines state corresponding values depending on setting, for example: a clinic blood pressure measurement of 130/80 mmHg corresponds to home blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, daytime ABPM 130/80 mmHg, night-time ABPM 110/65 mmHg, and 24-hour ABPM 125/75 mmHg.

The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends ABPM as the preferred method of out-of-office blood pressure measurement, followed by home blood pressure monitoring.

Home blood pressure readings should be recorded using a validated monitor when the patient is seated, with their back and arm supported, after 5 minutes’ rest. Two readings should be recorded, 1-2 minutes apart, in the morning (before taking medication) and again in the evening. Measurements should be taken for at least 3 days, ideally 7. The home blood pressure reading is the average of all of the measurements.

# Screening for hypertension

As most people with hypertension are asymptomatic, regular blood pressure measurements are recommended to detect the condition. The ACC/AHA recommend yearly measurements following an initial blood pressure evaluation. Adults with an elevated blood pressure should have a repeat evaluation in 3-6 months. The European Society of Cardiology recommends that patients with an office blood pressure of <120 mmHg systolic and <80 mmHg diastolic should have their blood pressure checked at least every 5 years. Patients with an office blood pressure of 120-129 mmHg systolic or 80-84 mmHg diastolic should have blood pressure measurements every 3 years. Patients with high-normal blood pressure (130-139 mmHg systolic and/or 85-89 mmHg diastolic) should have annual blood pressure measurements because they are at high risk of progression to hypertension.

# Concomitant cardiovascular risk factors

Establishing concomitant cardiovascular risk factors is essential to define overall cardiovascular risk.

- Smoking: enquiries should include type of cigarette or tobacco, quantity, and duration of habit. Patients have a tendency to under-report, and non-smokers may be exposed to passive cigarette smoking in the home if a partner is a heavy smoker.
- Diabetes mellitus: this is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The target blood pressure for a diabetic hypertensive patient is 130/80 mmHg.
- Known ischaemic heart disease or previous myocardial infarction.
- Previous cerebrovascular accident or transient ischaemic attack.

# Assessment of hypertension

# Diagnosis

- Elevation of cholesterol or triglycerides: patients may be unaware of such elevation if they have never been tested.
- Family history of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or renal disease.

# Identification of a secondary cause

Although in the majority of patients hypertension is primary/essential, there are certain features that may lead to a suspicion of an underlying cause (secondary hypertension):

- Young patient (<40 years)
- Rapid onset of hypertension
- Sudden change in blood pressure readings when previously well controlled on a particular therapy
- Resistant hypertension that is unresponsive to pharmacological therapies.

If a secondary cause is suspected, then the presence of specific symptoms may suggest a particular cause and guide further investigations:

|Specific Symptoms|Possible Cause|
|---|---|
|Flash pulmonary oedema or widespread atherosclerosis|Renal artery stenosis|
|Cold legs|Poor distal perfusion secondary to aortic coarctation|
|Swelling and hypertension in a pregnant patient|Pre-eclampsia|
|Oedema and reports of foamy urine in a non-pregnant patient|Nephrotic syndrome|
|History of renal impairment, prostatic enlargement, previous urethral instrumentation, or renal calculi|Obstructive uropathy or chronic kidney disease|
|Family history of polycystic kidney disease, intracranial aneurysms, or subarachnoid haemorrhage in a young patient (age 20-34 years) with hypertension|Polycystic kidney disease|
|Endocrine causes with episodic symptoms consistent with a hyper-adrenergic state|Phaeochromocytoma|
|Symptoms of low potassium|Hyperaldosteronism|
|Typical symptoms of Cushing's syndrome|Depression, weight gain, hirsutism, easy bruising, low libido|
|Heat intolerance, sweating, palpitations, and weight loss|Excess of thyroxine|
|Lethargy, constipation, weight gain, and depression|Low circulating thyroxine levels|
|Symptoms of bone pain, paraesthesiae, and myalgia|Hyperparathyroidism|
|Excessive daytime sleepiness in an obese patient|Obstructive sleep apnoea|
|Toxic causes|Use of oral contraceptive pill, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chronic alcohol excess|

Physical findings suggestive of a secondary cause include the following:

- Renal bruits may be audible with renal artery stenosis
- Enlarged kidneys may be palpated in polycystic kidney disease. There may be accompanying hepatomegaly or a hernia
- Arteriovenous fistulae may be present in a patient with end-stage kidney disease

# DIAGNOSIS Assessment of hypertension Diagnosis

Flank tenderness or prostatic enlargement on rectal examination may suggest a cause of obstructive uropapy
Facial oedema or limb oedema in a pregnant patient warrants urinary collection for proteinuria as suggestive of pre-eclampsia.
Oedema in a non-pregnant patient might be due to nephrotic syndrome.
Radio-femoral delay and a disparity in blood pressure readings between pe arms may be demonstrated wip coarctation of pe aorta, along wip systolic or continuous cardiac murmurs. Distal pulses may be weak or impalpable
Cushing's syndrome has well defined features, typically described as a moon face, pin arms and legs, truncal obesity, striae, and skin pinning
Isolated eyelid oedema wip dry skin and a pick tongue may suggest hypopyroidism, while exophpalmos, proptosis, and lid lag suggest hyperpyroidism due to Graves' disease
The deposition of calcium just inside pe iris, or palpation of jaw tumours, raises pe possibility of hyperparapyroidism
Obesity, maxillomandibular abnormalities, and macroglossia predispose to obstructive sleep apnoea
Chronic alcohol excess can result in a myriad of signs, such as jaundice, hepatomegaly, spider nevi, ascites, and general neglect of appearance.

# Target organ damage

# Cardiovascular disease

Symptoms of cardiac failure include shortness of breap, ankle oedema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, and orpopnoea. Angina may also be reported. Examination may reveal cardiac murmurs, prills, or heaves.
Left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed eiper by echocardiography or by electrocardiogram is well documented. It has prognostic utility in patients wip hypertension.

# Cerebrovascular disease

Any history of symptoms suggestive of transient ischaemic attack or stroke should be obtained. These may include speech difficulties, visual disturbance, or transient focal neurology.
Carotid bruits may indicate carotid artery stenosis and warrant furper duplex imaging to determine blood flow and degree of stenosis.
There may be residual functional loss after a stroke.

# Renal failure

May be asymptomatic, but urinary symptoms such as decreased or increased frequency of urination, pruritus, lepargy, and weight loss may suggest renal damage.

# Retinopathy

This is often asymptomatic, but may present wip visual loss or headaches.
Hypertensive retinopapy on fundoscopy is characterised by:

Arteriolar narrowing (graded 1-4 depending on pe degree of narrowing)
Arteriolar venous nipping (constriction of veins at crossing points)
'Cotton wool spots' on pe retina (due to ischaemic changes)
Flame haemorrhages or papilloedema.

# Assessment of hypertension

# Diagnosis

From the collection of Sunil Nadar, MBBS, MRCP and Gregory Lip, MD, FRCP, FESC, FACC

# Initial investigations

Baseline screening tests are useful in all patients to look for complications of hypertension.

- An ECG can be easily performed and is useful to seek signs of previous myocardial infarction or left ventricular hypertrophy (a key prognostic factor). Echocardiography may be reserved for patients with clinical suspicion of cardiac failure or left ventricular hypertrophy.
- A chest x-ray is helpful to look for evidence of cardiomegaly, widening of the left subclavian border, and a double bulge at the site of the aortic knuckle. This may be seen in coarctation of the aorta, along with notching of the ribs due to large collateral circulation.
- Initial blood tests should include urea, electrolytes, and creatinine, with random blood sugar and serum cholesterol (as part of overall cardiovascular risk assessment). If diabetes is suspected, a fasting blood sugar test is required. Potassium levels may be low in hyperaldosteronism, but are usually normal.
- A urine dip test is performed to look for glycosuria and proteinuria, and the presence of casts may help to determine an underlying renal cause, such as glomerulonephritis or nephrotic syndrome.

# Subsequent investigations

Specific tests are only recommended if the clinical suspicion of an underlying secondary cause is high, as the majority of patients will have essential hypertension. These include:

# Blood tests

DIAGNOSIS Assessment of hypertension Diagnosis

Plasma renin and aldosterone levels if hyperaldosteronism suspected. Adrenal vein sampling to compare pe ratio of renin to aldosterone in each kidney. A ratio >2 suggests an aldosterone-secreting tumour.[42] [43]
Plasma renin activity is elevated in most patients wip renal artery stenosis and is a good screening test.[44] A renal angiogram is pe most specific and sensitive test.[45]
Late-night salivary cortisol will be elevated in Cushing's disease, and pis can be confirmed wip pe overnight dexamepasone suppression test.
Liver function tests may be a useful screening tool if chronic alcohol excess and liver dysfunction are suspected.
Thyroid function tests, if clinical history leads to suspicion of hyper- or hypopyroidism.
Serum calcium levels can be measured if hyperparapyroidism is a possibility.

Urine tests

24-hour urine collection to measure: catecholamines to exclude a phaeochromocytoma; protein levels in suspected pre-eclampsia or nephrotic syndrome. However, in pe case of pre-eclampsia and nephritic syndrome, a spot urine creatinine ratio can offer comparable results.

Imaging

Ultrasound of kidneys and adrenal glands: a unilateral small kidney would be suspicious of chronic pyelonephritis or renal artery stenosis (causing renal atresia). Bilateral shrunken kidneys are consistent wip chronic renal failure. Hydronephrosis may confirm an obstructive cause. This could be followed by a computed tomography (CT) pyelogram if renal calculi are strongly suspected. Polycystic kidneys are easily visualised on abdominal ultrasound.
CT of adrenals: pis can be used to localise a phaeochromocytoma if urinary catecholamines are suggestive of pe diagnosis.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): can be used to investigate renal artery stenosis if a renal angiogram is contra-indicated. It can identify and characterise an aortic coarctation, and be used to plan furper treatment.[46] MRI is also useful for imaging pe adrenals to localise a tumour in hyperaldosteronism or phaeochromocytoma.

Special tests

Polysomnography is required for pe diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea in patients wip a consistent history. A fibre-optic endoscopy is routinely performed in pose patients in whom sleep apnoea is confirmed, as nasal polyps or tumours may be present.
Renal biopsy: pis is a definitive test to elicit pe underlying cause of nephrotic syndrome.
